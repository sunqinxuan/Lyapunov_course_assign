\section{Problem}

\indent simulate the following system
$$
\ddot{x}+0.1\dot{x}+x^5=6\sin{t}
$$
for two set of initial conditions
$$
x_0=2, \dot{x}_0=3
$$
and
$$
x_0=2.01, \dot{x}_0=3.01
$$

\section{Solution}

\indent Note that the given two initial conditions are almost identical. 

\indent As shown in Figure \ref{response_20} and Figure \ref{phase_plane_20}, the responses of the system to the two initial conditions nearly coincide within a certain period of time (about 25s). But after that, the responses become apparently different from each other, as shown in Figure \ref{response_50} and Figure \ref{phase_plane_50}.

\indent It is due to chaos in the system caused by the he high nonlinearity in $x_5$.
